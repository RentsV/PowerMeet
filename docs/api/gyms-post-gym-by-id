# POST /gyms

Running the base endpoint in PowerShell with a PUT method adds a new [`gym`](gym.md) object.

You can read a full tutorial on adding a new gym in Postman [`here`](../tutorials/add-a-new-gym.md).

## URL

```shell

{server_url}/gyms
```

## Request information

This call doesn't have any parameters.
You need to specify the fields in the request body,
otherwise it will create a gym with only an ID.

## Example

```js

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/gyms/5
```


## Return body

```js
